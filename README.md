# Ultravision

This was a project created back in 2013 for my sister.

The aim of this project was to help the visually impaired children to cope up with the physical environment and traverse easily without any guidance, both indoors and outdoors.

## Basics

Ultrasonic waves are very high frequency waves of the order of greater than 20000 Hz. These are sound waves that get reflected very similar to the ordinary audible sound waves and produces echoes. Due to its very high frequency ultrasound has much greater penetrating power than ordinary sound which makes it a good option to detect any object/obstacle. And if audible sound waves are used it would annoy the people or animals near-by. But humans cannot hear the sound waves in the ultrasonic frequencies which makes it a suitable candidate for numerous applications.

### Things used in this project

* Arduino Nano
* Ultrasonic sensors x 2
* Home made PCB
* Vibration motors x 2
* Battery
* Walking stick with a castor wheel fixed to the end
* Gloves modified with the vibration motors stictched onto them
* Neodymium magnets on the gloves and on the stick to hold the device in place
